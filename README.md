HOPR (High Order Preprocessor) is an open-source software for
the generation of three-dimensional unstructured high-order meshes.
These meshes are needed by high-order numerical methods like
Discontinuous Galerkin, Spectral Element Methods or pFEM,
in order to retain their accuracy if the computational domain
includes curved boundaries.

HOPR has been developed by the [**Numerics Research Group (NRG)**][nrg]
lead by Prof. Claus-Dieter Munz at the Institute of Aerodynamics
and Gasdynamics at the University of Stuttgart, Germany.

This is a scientific project. If you use HOPR for publications or
presentations in science, please support the project by citing
our publications given in [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).

## Installation / Documentation
